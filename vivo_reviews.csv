3,Amz Customer,2021-10-20,"Vivo Y33s is my 4th Vivo mobile, n m utterly disappointed with it, all the useful features have been removed in this model. Within 1 week I've had touch screen issues, doesn't connect to WiFi or mobile internet, doesn't detect SD card, shows 128 GB storage, but doesn't save any files, worst of all is the front camera, images are not the best, I regret buying this mobile",Verified Purchase,1

Cons-
1. Needs more improvement in fast charging as only 18 watt fast charging given, can charge phone in 1.5 hrs
2.Needs quad camera as triple camera given in back side (picture quality in rear camera was not good)
3.Littlebit handy

And i am facing below issues in my mobile
1. This mobile comes with the Google dailer. Which is the worst dailer, while recording the call other person will hear 'THIS CALL IS BEING RECORDED'. So there is no sense of giving the call recording feature.
2. There is no option to remove the google dailer( which is the default dailer)
3.battery backup is not good, because of the light weight battery drains too fast
4. Camera performance is poor ( not worth for this price range)
5. Audio clearity of voice call is not at all good.
6. There is no default video call option.",,1

145,Valairat (tukta),2021-11-25," Build quality - 8/10
Really good and tight build with creaking sounds. But, if they had given a real glass back and Corning's gorilla glass at front would be great.
As of now, I am unsure of protection of front glass.

Design - 9.5/10
I just love the colour Midday Dream.... So beautiful üòç
And one of my criteria was to have a flat frame on the sides.... This phone is very good to hold and feels light... but after holding for about 10 mins, it becomes slippery. Wear a case for phone and use it..

Display - 7/10
Colours are very very close to amoled displays, but lcd is a lcd, and blacks are not blacks.... And refresh rate is still 60hz..
Brightness was decently enough though....

Loud speaker - 8/10
Good, but not loud enough. Bass could be a little more, but it gets the job done...

Earpiece (Calling speaker) -11/10
Extremely loud and quality was very very good. And there were no interruptions from proximity sensor in call... You can try playing a video while calling and you can test the speaker in the ways you want.

3.5mm jack output - 11/10
Sound quality was really outstanding.... Definitely the best I have used so far.... I was using the inbox headsets and realme buds 2...
I saw a person asking whether it has Dolby Atmos or no.. the answer is no.
But it has a technology called ""Deepfield"" and it is identical to Dolby Atmos in Samsung phones... Mega bass mode is recommended.

Inbox headset -9.5/10
High quality headsets. Good bass, almost equal to realme buds 2. But buttons had a delay when responding.

Performance -5/10
Yes, yes, yes. Mediatek helio G80 is definitely not for gaming, but it is power efficient. But day to day tasks like opening WhatsApp, browsing news, etc. were fine. But those who need aggressive power, spend extra Rs.2000 and buy Y73 or go for POCO X3 pro. I haven't played any games, so I unable to tell about that.

Battery - 9/10 , Charging - 7/10
Battery is excellent. It can even beat few Samsung phones that have 5000mah battery. Well optimised. Charging is good for 18w. Please prefer for slower charging phones as charging fast will make the battery to drain and degrade fast... I was using a phone with 5000mah battery with 33w fast charging. Guess what, battery gets down very fast.

CAMERAS...... 6/10
To be frank, it performed somewhat okay. Colours were true to life, and look good in daytime. But at night, the camera was average... Even with the night mode, it performed above average(for both rear and front). But the gallery app has magic eraser, which is very famed for the recent Pixel phone. Videos were good, but no option to turn of stabilization. Recording is capped to 1080p 30 max. So if you need 1080p 60, or 4k 60, download ""open camera"" to use it.

Software and biometrics -8/10
Software was excellent. Feature rich and similar to stock Android. Few bloatwares very present while set up. You can even customise the charging animation of the phone! Android 12 beta test might start from March 2022. But this phone has Google dialer and messaging app. I was very disappointed to see this. Fingerprint reader was fast and face unlock is also good.

Verdict,
If you are a hardcore fan of vivo or you need a phone with really good battery or you need a phone with big display and best design, this the phone for you....

Hope this might help in purchasing this phone..... Have a great day ‚ò∫Ô∏è",,4

220,Vignesh,2022-04-07,"Likes:
1. Availability of 4gb virtual RAM, in addition to 8gn RAM.
2. Camera quality is good in daylight. Though the night capture mode is good, could improve
3. For 128gb internal storage, this is a starting range phone available

Dislikes:
1. Wi-Fi connectivity is the poorest. The phone is not able to support any sort of Wi-Fi connectivity. Often it either gets disconnected or browsing using Wi-Fi is very slow. If you use the speed test, actual speed of Wi-Fi would come up, but browsing is the worst",,3
