Amz Customer,Reviewed in India on 20 October 2021,"Vivo Y33s is my 4th Vivo mobile, n m utterly disappointed with it, all the useful features have been removed in this model. Within 1 week I've had touch screen issues, doesn't connect to WiFi or mobile internet, doesn't detect SD card, shows 128 GB storage, but doesn't save any files, worst of all is the front camera, images are not the best, I regret buying this mobile",1
